      <h1>Our Mission</h1>

      <p>Our mission is to empower women, especially those in underprivileged communities, by providing access to coding education, mentorship, and career-building resources. We strive to bridge the gender and economic gap in technology by creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment where women can develop the skills they need to thrive in the digital economy. Through collaboration, innovation, and education, we aim to inspire the next generation of female leaders in tech and drive meaningful change in the industry.</p>
      
      <p>Women face significant barriers in computer science, from gender stereotypes and limited access to education to financial constraints and a lack of mentorship. Many struggle with workplace bias, imposter syndrome, and balancing career and personal responsibilities. Without representation and support, women are often discouraged from pursuing or staying in tech. Overcoming these challenges is essential for fostering innovation, economic empowerment, and a more inclusive industry. By providing education, mentorship, and opportunities, we can break these barriers and ensure that women, regardless of background, have the chance to succeed in technology.</strong></p>
